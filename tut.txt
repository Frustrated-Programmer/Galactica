__**TUTORIAL FOR GALACTICA**__

Now some of you may/have been confused with the gameplay of Galactica.
Or some of you are joining us for the first time and i welcome you :D

Now to start playing just send `-join` to create an account.

To get yourself started we're going to need people to *run* our stations later.
So lets find us some planets!

**Finding a planet**

use `-scan` to look around you. Don't see an available planet?
use `-warp 10 10` to warp to the middle of the map.
wait for the warp to finish and run `-scan` again.
If you STILL cant find a planet use `-warp NUMBER NUMBER` to warp around until you find one.
__*MAKE SURE THE PLANET DOESN'T HAVE A RED FLAG ON IT, IF IT DOES THAT MEANS SOMEONE ELSE OWNS IT*__

**Colonizing**
Now that you've found a planet double check if its habitable by running `-Look`
if its uninhabitable use `-warp NUMBER NUMBER` to go find another
otherwise run `-colonize` to colonize that planet.
Wait for the planet to finish colonizing.
__*DO NOT WARP UNTIL ITS FINISHED*__

Now you have a colony! Most colonies Give you people unless its Uninhabitable.
And *some* even give you credits and food depending on the amount of people living on it.

Now run `-collect`. If you get an error. Wait the time remaining the error says.
Otherwise... Hurray! You've collected!

Now we'll make an `Mining Station`

???///breakpoint\\\???
**Finding a empty spot**

Use `-scan` and `-warp NUMBER NUMBER` to find a empty spot.
Now use `-stations list` to view all the stations.
and use `-station info Mining Station` to get information about that station.

**Building a station**
Now that we know what it does. lets build one!
Run `-build Mining Station` and wait for it to finish.
__*DO NOT WARP UNTIL ITS FINISHED*__

Now that you have a station.
run `-collect`. If you get an error. Wait the time remaining the error says.
Otherwise... Congratulations!!!

Now every so often run `-collect` until you get `20` :people: people.
check how much you have via `-stats`

**Getting Food**
When you have 20 people.
find a empty spot and build a `Agriculture Station`
This station gives you food. Food is what you need to build more colonies.

Come back to read the rest after you've accomplished
```css
1 more colony
100 more people
1 refining station
1 research station```

???///breakpoint\\\???

Now that you have a `Research Station` you should be getting :bulb: Research via `collect`

**Research Info**
You can now research items!
lets figure out what all the research items are so run `-research list`

:thinking: so lets figure out what each does, so run `-research info Gravatic Purification`

now check to see if you have enough :bulb: research.
if you don't then keep `-collect`ing

if you do then continue :D

**Researching**
Lets research `Gravatic Purification`
so run `-research Gravatic Purification`
and now we need to wait for the research to be complete.

Once its complete you have now unlocked new items :D

???///breakpoint\\\???

**Attacking**
If you use `-scan` and `-warp NUMBER NUMBER`
try to find a Enemy planet or station.
you can attack it via `-attackStation` or `-attackColony`
__*Warning the owner will be notified so keep your guard up*__

You can do the same to your **OWN** stations and colonies if you want to get rid of it.

If you warp to a player you can attack him/her via `-attackPlayer PLAYER_ID`
You can get a list of all players where you're at via `-lookAround`
